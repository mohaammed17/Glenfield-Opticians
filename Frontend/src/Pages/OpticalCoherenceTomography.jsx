                Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a cutting-edge, non-invasive imaging technique that provides high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the retina and other structures within the eye. It plays a crucial role in the early detection and monitoring of various eye conditions such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic eye disease.

                Unlike traditional methods, OCT allows optometrists to view the layers of the retina in remarkable detail ‚Äî enabling more accurate diagnoses, earlier intervention, and improved treatment outcomes.

                At Glenfield Opticians, we offer OCT as an additional diagnostic service for patients who wish to have a more thorough eye health assessment. The results of the scan are displayed on a large screen, where our optometrist will explain the findings in detail.

              <p className="text-muted" style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                If the results indicate the need for further investigation, we will arrange a specialist referral promptly to ensure you receive the necessary care without delay.

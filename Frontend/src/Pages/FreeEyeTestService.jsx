              <p className="text-muted" style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                Your eyesight is your most precious sense and deserves the highest standards of professional care.
                After all, without good vision it is difficult to enjoy most everyday activities, including reading, driving and watching TV.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted" style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                But poor sight may also indicate the presence of potentially serious eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular degeneration, or general health problems like diabetes and high blood pressure.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted" style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                Because eye conditions often develop slowly and can be painless, you may not notice any initial symptoms. That’s why it is essential to have your eyes examined regularly by an optometrist or ophthalmic medical practitioner. The sooner any problem is detected, the greater the chance of it being treated successfully.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted" style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                This leaflet explains what happens during an eye examination at our practice and how we will take care of your vision. We recommend that you read it carefully as it will help you to understand and look after your eyesight.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted" style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
                If you have any concerns about your vision, you should contact us immediately. We provide quality eyecare and will always take as much time as necessary to examine your eyes thoroughly and answer any questions you may have.

                There is much more to your eye examination at our practice than finding out if you need spectacles or contact lenses. We also carry out a range of tests to assess the health of your eyes. And because everyone’s eyesight is different, we tailor the eye examination to your individual circumstances. This may include the following elements and other tests where appropriate, based on our professional evaluation of your visual requirements.

                    <p><strong>■ History and symptoms:</strong> First of all, we discuss any problems you might have with your eyesight and general health. Many eye conditions are health-related and it is important that you let us know if you are taking any medicines as these may affect your vision. To assess your visual needs, we also discuss your work and leisure activities.</p>

                    <p><strong>■ Spectacles assessment:</strong> If you already wear spectacles or contact lenses, you should bring these to your appointment. We will then check the lenses to establish their type, optical power, and how well you can see with them.</p>
                  </div>

                    <p><strong>■ Refraction:</strong> This part of the examination finds out whether you need an optical prescription and, if so, which lenses give you the best vision. We check your near vision (for reading), your distance vision (for driving or TV) and your intermediate vision (for hobbies or computer work). These refraction tests will reveal if you are short-sighted, long-sighted, presbyopic or have astigmatism. As everyone’s vision changes over time you may experience one or more of the above conditions. However, all can be corrected with spectacles or contact lenses.</p>

                    <p><strong>■ Oculomotor balance:</strong> It is important that your eye muscles work together. This test checks that both your eyes are coordinated and that you have comfortable vision at all distances.</p>

                    <p><strong>■ Pupil reflexes:</strong> The pupil controls the amount of light reaching the retina at the back of your eye and so affects images seen by the brain. An unusual pupil reflex may indicate neurological problems.</p>

                    <p><strong>■ Intraocular pressure:</strong> This test measures the pressure inside your eyes. Too much pressure can indicate glaucoma, a disease which eventually leads to blindness if untreated. The test is usually carried out on people over 40 or those with glaucoma in the family. The results are evaluated in conjunction with a visual field test and ophthalmoscopy.</p>

                  <div className="timeline-content">
                    <p><strong>■ Visual field test:</strong> Testing your all-round vision can detect glaucoma and other neurological conditions. Particular attention is paid to your peripheral sight as losing your field of vision is one of the main signs of glaucoma.</p>

                    <p><strong>■ Ophthalmoscopy:</strong> This is a very important part of your examination because it checks the health of your eyes. Using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope, a light is shone through your pupil into the eye. This enables us to see the internal parts clearly, such as your lens, retina and optic nerve, and so check for problems like diabetes, cataracts, hypertension, glaucoma and macular degeneration.</p>

                    <p><strong>■ Visual Assessment:</strong> When your eye examination is finished, we give you an explanation of your vision and your eye health, plus a copy of your optical prescription. We then recommend a time for your next eye examination based on your visual needs. Our optometrist will also be happy to answer any questions you may have about your sight and the eye examination.</p>
